# Bengaluru-home-price-prediction
A machine learning project to predict real estate prices in Bengaluru, India, based on various property features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. The model is trained using a cleaned and preprocessed dataset sourced from Kaggle.
üìò Project Description: Bengaluru Home Price Prediction
This notebook presents a step-by-step machine learning workflow aimed at predicting residential property prices in Bengaluru, India. The primary objective is to train a regression model using various property-related features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms. The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of diverse information about housing units across the city.

üßπ Data Loading & Cleaning
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. These tools provide a strong foundation for data analysis and exploratory data visualization throughout the notebook.

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file named Bengaluru_House_Data.csv. An initial look at the data is performed using head() to understand the structure and content. The shape of the data (i.e., number of rows and columns) is also checked to understand its scale.

To simplify the dataset and focus on features most relevant to price prediction, a few columns deemed unnecessary for this task are removed. These include area_type, society, balcony, and availability. This step helps reduce noise in the data and streamline the modeling process.

üîç Exploratory Analysis
Before moving forward with modeling, a brief analysis is performed on categorical fields such as area_type. The data is grouped and counted based on unique area types to understand their distribution. This insight helps in deciding which fields should be retained or dropped.

üõ†Ô∏è Handling Missing Data
A crucial step in preparing the dataset is identifying and handling missing values. Using null value checks, the notebook highlights columns that contain incomplete data. These missing entries are removed entirely to ensure that the model is trained on clean and reliable data. After dropping null values, the new DataFrame (df3) is validated again to confirm that no further missing values exist.

üß† Feature Engineering
One of the core preprocessing steps includes transforming the size column, which contains strings like "2 BHK" or "4 Bedroom", into a new numerical column called bhk. This numeric representation allows the model to treat the number of bedrooms as a quantitative feature, which is essential for regression analysis.

This kind of feature engineering ensures that the data is in a machine-readable format and that the input features are meaningful predictors of the target variable (price). Further transformations and handling of inconsistent data‚Äîsuch as non-standard values in square footage‚Äîare also anticipated in the next steps of the notebook.
The notebook sets a solid foundation for moving into deeper feature engineering, outlier detection, one-hot encoding for categorical features (especially locations), and building regression models. Techniques like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, or Decision Tree Regressors may be applied to train a model that can accurately estimate housing prices based on user input or new listings.
